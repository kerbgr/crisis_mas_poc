    "answer": "Initial attack response must be rapid and aggressive within the first 24 hours. Deploy first-response crews immediately to assess fire behavior, fuel conditions, and weather patterns. Establish incident command structure using ICS protocols. Priority actions: (1) Size-up: evaluate fire spread potential and threatened structures, (2) Anchor-Flank-Pinch: start suppression at a secure anchor point and work along flanks, (3) Request air support if conditions allow (wind <25mph, visibility >3 miles), (4) Establish safety zones and escape routes per LCES protocol (Lookouts, Communications, Escape routes, Safety zones), (5) Begin community notification and potential evacuation warnings. If objectives aren't met within 24 hours, transition to extended attack with additional resources and updated Incident Action Plan.",

    "answer": "Strategic firing (burnout operations) requires careful planning and specific conditions. Pre-requisites: (1) Incident Commander approval with written firing plan, (2) Weather window: relative humidity >25%, wind speed 5-15mph with consistent direction, (3) Qualified Firing Boss present. Execution sequence: (1) Identify control lines (roads, rivers, bulldozer lines), (2) Use drone reconnaissance to map terrain and fuel loads, (3) Deploy firing teams with drip torches or aerial ignition devices, (4) Ignite from downwind side moving into wind to create low-intensity backing fire, (4) Monitor fire behavior continuously with lookouts, (5) Maintain escape routes and safety zones. Modern practice integrates thermal imaging drones to track fire intensity and predict behavior. Purpose is to remove fuel between control line and advancing fire, creating a defensible zone.

    "answer": "Evacuation timing is life-critical and must be initiated early. Decision triggers: (1) Fire growth rate exceeds containment capacity, (2) Wind speeds forecast to exceed 30mph, (3) Fire front within 2-3 hours of populated areas based on rate of spread calculations, (4) Spot fires occurring ahead of main fire. Implementation protocol: Phase 1 - READY: Issue warnings 12+ hours advance, advise residents to prepare go-bags and identify evacuation routes. Phase 2 - SET: Mandatory preparation 4-6 hours before anticipated impact, close schools and non-essential services. Phase 3 - GO: Mandatory evacuation order with law enforcement support. Execution priorities: (1) Evacuate mobility-impaired and medical-dependent residents first, (2) Use multi-channel notification (Emergency Alert System, social media, door-to-door), (3) Establish traffic control points to prevent contra-flow, (4) Designate evacuation routes away from fire direction, (5) Open emergency shelters before evacuation begins. Critical rule: Never wait until fire is visible to evacuate - this is already too late. Plan for 30-50% non-compliance requiring emergency rescue resources.",

    "question": "How do you implement START triage in a multi-casualty incident?",
    "answer": "START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) enables rapid patient sorting in mass casualty situations. Triage Categories: (1) RED/Immediate: life-threatening injuries requiring immediate intervention to survive, (2) YELLOW/Delayed: serious injuries but stable for 30-60 minutes, (3) GREEN/Minor: walking wounded, can wait hours, (4) BLACK/Deceased or expectant: no pulse/breathing after airway opening, or injuries incompatible with life. START algorithm execution (30-60 seconds per patient): Step 1 - Global Assessment: announce 'Anyone who can walk, move to [designated area]' - these are GREEN. Step 2 - Individual Assessment of remaining patients: Check RESPIRATIONS: (a) Not breathing: open airway, if still not breathing = BLACK, if breathing starts = RED, (b) Breathing faster than 30/min = RED, (c) Breathing less than 30/min: proceed to perfusion. Check PERFUSION: (a) Radial pulse absent or capillary refill >2 seconds = RED, (b) Radial pulse present: proceed to mental status. Check MENTAL STATUS: (a) Cannot follow simple commands = RED, (b) Can follow commands = YELLOW. Triage marking: (1) Use triage tags/ribbons attached to patient, (2) Mark clearly visible for retrieval teams, (3) Record tag number, time, and triage category. Treatment during triage: (1) Only life-saving interventions: open airway, control catastrophic bleeding with tourniquet, (2) No detailed assessment or prolonged treatment, (3) Move immediately to next patient. Triage pit supervision: (1) Assign triage officer to oversee sorting, (2) Establish collection points for each category, (3) Re-triage patients every 15-30 minutes as conditions change. Expect approximately 80% GREEN, 15% YELLOW/RED, 5% BLACK in typical MCIs.",

    "question": "How do you coordinate hospital notification and patient distribution during an MCI?",
    "answer": "Hospital coordination prevents overwhelming single facilities and ensures appropriate care. Pre-incident planning: (1) Establish regional hospital coalition with bed capacity data, (2) Define specialty capabilities: trauma center, burn center, pediatrics, stroke center, (3) Create hospital diversion protocols and surge capacity plans, (4) Conduct regular drills and update contact lists quarterly. Immediate notification: (1) Initial alert within 5 minutes of MCI declaration: estimated patient numbers by triage category, incident type, hazmat concerns if applicable, (2) Use multi-channel notification: radio, phone, emergency notification system, (3) Alert regional medical coordination center to activate mutual aid. Patient distribution strategy: (1) Match patient acuity to hospital capability: trauma patients to Level 1/2 trauma centers, yellow/green to community hospitals, (2) Avoid sending all patients to closest hospital - distribute regionally, (3) Reserve air medical transport for critical patients going to distant specialized centers, (4) Maximum safe patient load: 25-30% increase above normal ED census per hospital. Hospital status reporting: (1) Each facility reports current ED capacity, ICU beds, OR availability, specialist coverage every 15 minutes during active incident, (2) Declare diversion/closure when at capacity, (3) Update as patients discharge or transfer. Ground ambulance coordination: (1) Designate transportation officer at scene, (2) Assign specific hospitals to each departing ambulance, (3) Document patient tag number, destination, departure time, (4) Confirm arrival with receiving facility, (5) Rotate ambulances through multiple hospitals to prevent clustering. Special considerations: (1) Pediatric patients to pediatric-capable facilities, (2) Burns >20% to burn center, (3) Keep families together when possible, (4) Establish family reunification center at separate location from hospitals.",

    "question": "What are the protocols for family reunification after a mass casualty incident?",
    "answer": "Family reunification is critical for victim identification and psychological recovery. Immediate setup: (1) Establish Family Assistance Center (FAC) separate from hospitals and incident scene within 2-4 hours of MCI, (2) Select accessible location with parking, privacy rooms, childcare area, (3) Staff with crisis counselors, victim advocates, Red Cross, law enforcement investigators, medical examiners if fatalities. Registration process: (1) Collect information from families: missing person description, photo, dental records, medical conditions, unique identifiers, (2) DNA samples if mass fatality involved, (3) Emergency contact preferences, (4) Special needs of family members. Patient tracking: (1) Compile master list from all hospitals: patient tag numbers, John/Jane Doe numbers, known identities, current hospital location, condition updates, (2) Cross-reference with family inquiries, (3) Update every hour minimum with hospital reports. Notification protocols: (1) Always notify in person, never by phone if death or critical injury, (2) Use trained crisis counselors with law enforcement present, (3) Provide accurate information - avoid speculation, (4) Coordinate hospital visits and transportation for families. Information management: (1) Establish 1-800 family information hotline managed by trained operators, (2) Create secure family notification database, (3) Never release patient information publicly before family notification, (4) Respect HIPAA while balancing family right to know. Support services: (1) Crisis counseling available 24/7, (2) Chaplain services for multiple faiths, (3) Childcare for families spending extended time at FAC, (4) Food, lodging assistance for out-of-town families, (5) Language interpreters. Long-term follow-up: (1) Maintain FAC minimum 3-5 days, (2) Transition to long-term victim assistance programs, (3) Anniversary support services, (4) Connect families with survivor networks.",

    "question": "How do you manage the psychological aftermath and critical incident stress for first responders after an MCI?",
    "answer": "First responder psychological care is essential for long-term resilience and preventing PTSD. Immediate support (0-24 hours): (1) Tactical pause: brief rest periods during extended operations with food, hydration, (2) Buddy system: responders check on partners for signs of acute stress, (3) Rotate personnel out of high-stress roles (body recovery, pediatric casualties) every 2-3 hours, (4) Peer support team presence on scene for informal check-ins. Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM): (1) Defusing: 30-45 minute small group discussion within 8 hours of incident, led by peer support or mental health professional, focuses on facts and stress reactions, (2) Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD): formal 2-3 hour structured group session 2-7 days post-incident, addresses thoughts, reactions, symptoms, and coping, mandatory attendance for all incident participants. Warning signs monitoring: (1) Sleep disturbance, nightmares, (2) Hypervigilance, startle response, (3) Intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, (4) Avoidance of incident reminders, (5) Irritability, anger outbursts, (6) Substance use increase, (7) Relationship problems. Organizational support: (1) Administrative leave/mental health days without stigma, (2) Access to confidential mental health services separate from employment files, (3) Spouse/family education sessions about vicarious trauma, (4) Anniversary recognition and check-ins. Special considerations: (1) Providers who treated children often have strongest reactions, (2) Providers who personally knew victims require additional support, (3) Responders with recent personal losses or traumas more vulnerable. Long-term support: (1) Employee Assistance Program (EAP) referrals with unlimited sessions for incident-related care, (2) Routine screening at 1, 3, 6, 12 months post-incident, (3) Peer support program for ongoing informal support, (4) Resilience training as ongoing professional development.

    "question": "What are the immediate response protocols during and immediately after an earthquake?",
    "answer": "Earthquake response has distinct phases requiring specific actions. During shaking (Drop-Cover-Hold On): (1) DROP to hands and knees to prevent being knocked down, (2) Take COVER under sturdy desk or table, protect head and neck with arms, (3) HOLD ON to shelter and be prepared to move with it. If no shelter available: protect head/neck and move away from windows, exterior walls, anything that could fall. Special locations: In bed - stay there, cover head with pillow. In vehicle - pull over away from buildings, overpasses, trees, power lines, stay inside with seatbelt on. Outdoors - move to clear area away from buildings, trees, power lines. DO NOT run outside during shaking - most injuries occur from falling debris entering/exiting buildings. Immediately after shaking stops (first 2 minutes): (1) Check yourself for injuries, administer first aid, (2) Check others, provide assistance if trained, (3) If trapped, protect mouth/nose from dust, tap on pipe or wall, use whistle if available, shout only as last resort to conserve air. Building evacuation (2-5 minutes): (1) Use stairs only, never elevators, (2) Watch for fallen debris, damaged stairs, hanging objects, (3) Stay away from windows and exterior walls, (4) Assist mobility-impaired persons, (5) Evacuate to open assembly area minimum 100 feet from buildings. Post-evacuation safety: (1) Remain in open area away from buildings, power lines, trees, (2) Account for all building occupants, (3) Do not re-enter damaged buildings, (4) Avoid using phones except emergencies to keep lines clear, (5) Expect aftershocks - repeat Drop-Cover-Hold On. Facility shutdown: (1) Turn off natural gas if leaks suspected or ordered, (2) Shut off electricity at main breaker if damage visible, (3) Shut off water main if pipes broken. Emergency services may be overwhelmed - communities should be self-sufficient for minimum 72 hours.",

    "question": "How do you conduct rapid structural assessment and building safety evaluation after an earthquake?",
    "answer": "Structural assessment determines safe occupancy and prevents collapse casualties. Assessment priorities: (1) Critical facilities first: hospitals, fire stations, emergency operations centers, schools, shelters, (2) Residential buildings in order of occupancy density, (3) Commercial and industrial facilities. ATC-20 Evaluation procedure: (1) Exterior assessment from public right-of-way, (2) Interior inspection if exterior shows no severe damage, (3) Post evaluation placard on main entrance. Placard categories: GREEN (Inspected - Lawful Occupancy): No apparent structural hazard, building is safe to occupy, minor damage only. YELLOW (Limited Entry - Restricted Use): Moderate structural damage, enter at own risk for brief periods only to retrieve essential items, no sleeping or extended occupancy. RED (Unsafe - Do Not Enter): Severe structural damage or imminent collapse hazard, entry prohibited, building requires demolition or extensive repair before occupancy. Evaluation criteria: Exterior inspection: (1) Foundation displacement or collapse, (2) Leaning or out-of-plumb walls (>3% lean), (3) Cracked or damaged load-bearing walls, (4) Parapets, chimneys, or architectural elements in danger of falling, (5) Ground subsidence or liquefaction. Interior inspection: (1) Structural cracks in walls, columns, beams, (2) Ceiling or floor sag/deflection, (3) Stair structural integrity, (4) Collapsed or severely damaged portions, (5) Gas leaks or electrical hazards. Special considerations: (1) Aftershock potential: each aftershock may cause additional damage requiring re-evaluation, (2) Rain: water infiltration through damage can cause progressive failure, (3) Pre-existing conditions: older unreinforced masonry buildings particularly vulnerable. Evaluator requirements: (1) Licensed professional engineer or certified building inspector, (2) ATC-20 training completed, (3) Safety equipment: hard hat, safety vest, flashlight, camera, (4) Evaluation forms and placards. Documentation: (1) Photo documentation of all significant damage, (2) Sketches showing damage locations, (3) Completed evaluation forms filed with building department, (4) Database entry for regional damage mapping.",

    "question": "What are the search and rescue protocols for earthquake-damaged structures?",
    "answer": "Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) follows systematic protocols to maximize survivor recovery while protecting rescuers. Operational phases: (1) Phase 1 - Reconnaissance: document extent of damage, identify high-probability survivor locations, (2) Phase 2 - Surface rescue: remove victims accessible without structural breach, (3) Phase 3 - Void search: locate and access survivors in accessible voids, (4) Phase 4 - Selected debris removal: carefully remove debris to access trapped victims, (5) Phase 5 - General debris removal: systematic clearance after live rescues completed. Search methodology: (1) Systematic grid search: divide area into manageable sectors, (2) Mark buildings searched with spray paint: X with quadrant completion marks, date, team ID, hazards noted, victim count, (3) Conduct primary search (rapid, surface victims) then secondary search (detailed, concealed victims). Victim location techniques: (1) Visual search of accessible areas, (2) Canine search teams for scent detection in voids, (3) Electronic listening devices for sounds of tapping or voice, (4) Thermal imaging for heat signatures, (5) Call-and-listen periods: announce presence, request response, impose silence to listen. Structural stabilization: (1) Shore damaged walls and ceilings before entry, (2) Use cribbing and pneumatic shores for temporary support, (3) Cut through structures methodically to avoid progressive collapse, (4) Continuously monitor structure for movement or sounds indicating instability. Victim extrication: (1) Medical assessment before moving if possible, (2) Provide IV fluids, oxygen, pain management during extrication, (3) Treat crush syndrome risk if limb compressed >4 hours: IV fluids before release to prevent shock, (4) Use air bags, hydraulic tools, hand tools depending on situation, (5) Document injuries and treatment for hospital handoff. Safety priorities: (1) Rescuer safety paramount - do not create additional victims, (2) Require full structural PPE: helmet, goggles, gloves, boots, (3) Work in teams with constant communication, (4) Monitor atmosphere for gas leaks, oxygen levels, (5) Rotate crews every 45 minutes in strenuous operations. Demobilization criteria: (1) Typically 72-96 hours post-earthquake for trapped victim survival without water, (2) Continue searches until all accessible areas checked, (3) Transition to recovery operations for confirmed fatalities.",

    "question": "What is the RUN-HIDE-FIGHT protocol for active shooter situations?",
    "answer": "Active shooter events require immediate protective action. RUN: If there is an accessible escape path: (1) Leave belongings behind, (2) Help others escape if possible but don't delay your own escape, (3) Run in zigzag pattern if in line of sight, (4) Keep hands visible when encountering law enforcement, (5) Follow officer instructions exactly, (6) Call 911 once safe. Do not stop running until completely out of building and far from scene. HIDE: If evacuation not possible: (1) Find hiding place out of shooter's view, (2) Lock and barricade doors with heavy furniture, (3) Silence cell phones (not vibrate - completely silent), (4) Hide behind solid objects, not just visual cover, (5) Spread out if in group, (6) Remain quiet and still, (7) Don't come out until positively identified law enforcement gives all clear. Ideal hiding: locked room, heavy barricade, solid walls, no windows, communication capability. FIGHT: As absolute last resort when life in imminent danger: (1) Act with complete aggression, (2) Improvise weapons: fire extinguisher, scissors, chairs, belts, (3) Commit fully - this is survival, (4) Aim for head and eyes, (5) Work as group to overwhelm, (6) Create noise and confusion, (7) Do not stop until threat neutralized. Police response: (1) First officers will bypass victims to locate and stop shooter, (2) Rescue teams will follow to evacuate victims, (3) Keep hands visible, don't make sudden movements, (4) Expect to be treated as potential suspect until identified. Information for 911: (1) Location of shooter(s), (2) Number of shooters, (3) Physical description and clothing, (4) Weapons observed, (5) Number of victims if known. Evacuation: (1) Don't touch anything for evidence preservation, (2) Leave in direction away from shooting, (3) Expect long detention for interviews, (4) Mental health support will be available.
