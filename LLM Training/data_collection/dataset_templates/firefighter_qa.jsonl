What are your immediate actions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a critical situation requiring immediate evacuation, not fire suppression. With only 8 personnel and extreme fire conditions (40 km/h winds, high temperature), direct attack is too dangerous and ineffective. My actions:\n\n**Immediate (0-5 minutes)**:\n1. Order full village evacuation via both fire trucks\n2. Request Canadair CL-415 air support immediately via 1-1-2 coordination center\n3. Request all available ground units from surrounding areas\n4. Prioritize elderly, children, and mobility-impaired residents for truck transport\n\n**Short-term (5-15 minutes)**:\n5. Establish safe evacuation routes away from wind direction (southeast/east)\n6. Set rally point 5km upwind from village with medical screening\n7. If time permits before last evacuation, create minimal defensive perimeter at village perimeter using trucks' water supply\n8. Assign 2 firefighters to perform final sweep of village\n\n**Do NOT**: Attempt direct fire attack with insufficient personnel. Life safety is absolute priority. The village structures can be rebuilt; lives cannot be replaced."}]}

Water will spread the burning liquid and make fire worse. Use foam to create a blanket that excludes oxygen and prevents vapor release."}]}

There is a visible white vapor cloud. What is your HAZMAT response plan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ammonia (UN1005) is a toxic, corrosive gas requiring immediate Level A HAZMAT response. This is a major incident requiring multi-agency coordination.\n\n**Immediate Actions (0-10 min)**:\n1. Establish hot zone: 500m radius minimum, 1km if wind present\n2. Evacuate downwind areas immediately - ammonia vapor is lighter than air initially but can be dense at high concentrations\n3. Request HAZMAT specialist unit and decontamination equipment\n4. Alert EKAB for mass casualty preparation (ammonia inhalation injuries)\n5. Close Attiki Odos in both directions, 2km radius\n\n**Scene Management**:\n6. Approach from upwind, uphill if possible\n7. Wear full Level A protection (SCBA + vapor-tight suit) - ammonia concentration may exceed IDLH (300 ppm)\n8. No water spray initially (reacts exothermically with ammonia)\n9. Coordinate with Elefsina industrial fire brigade (specialized equipment)\n10. Request chemical advisor from manufacturer\n\n**Mitigation**:\n11. After specialist arrival, apply water fog (NOT direct stream) to knock down vapor cloud\n12. Contain liquid ammonia with dikes if leaking\n13. Prepare for long-duration incident (6-12 hours minimum)\n\n**Public Protection**: Shelter-in-place for downwind residents (close windows, turn off HVAC). Ammonia odor threshold is 5 ppm but toxic effects start at 25-50 ppm, IDLH is 300 ppm. This is life-threatening within 1km downwind."}]}

This principle guides all firefighting tactics:\n\n**Removing Heat (Most Common)**:\n- Water application: Absorbs heat through evaporation (water's high specific heat capacity)\n- Ventilation: Releases hot gases, reduces thermal feedback\n- Exposure protection: Cool adjacent structures to prevent fire spread\n\n**Removing Oxygen**:\n- Smothering with foam (Class B fires)\n- Closing doors/windows (ventilation-controlled fires)\n- CO2 or inert gas flooding (electrical rooms)\n- Dirt/sand burial (small outdoor fires)\n\n**Removing Fuel**:\n- Firebreaks in wildland fires\n- Shutting off gas valves\n- Creating defensible space around structures\n- Removing combustible materials from fire path\n\n**Tactical Application**: In wildland fires, we often can't remove oxygen (open atmosphere) and cooling with water is limited (large area). Therefore, fuel removal (bulldozer breaks, controlled burns) becomes the primary tactic. In structure fires, we have abundant water so heat removal is preferred."}]}

Confirm if anyone trapped in fire apartment\n2. Assess evacuation needs for floors above fire (3rd-6th floors)\n3. Check stairwells for smoke contamination (may need to shelter-in-place instead of evacuate)\n\n**Initial Actions (First 10 minutes)**:\n1. **Establish command**: Designate command post at safe location with visibility\n2. **Request additional resources**: Minimum 2 more engines, 1 ladder truck, EKAB ambulance, ELAS for crowd control\n3. **Primary search**: Send 2-firefighter team with SCBA to fire apartment (search before water application if victims suspected)\n4. **Attack line**: Deploy 45mm hose line to 2nd floor, attack fire from interior (safer than exterior for occupants above)\n5. **Vertical ventilation**: Check for fire extension to 3rd floor via windows or floor penetration\n6. **Evacuation**: Begin systematic evacuation of floors 3-6 if stairwell tenable; otherwise shelter-in-place with wet towels under doors\n7. **Exposure protection**: Protect adjacent units (horizontal) with secondary line if needed\n\n**Safety considerations**: Account for all personnel (2-in/2-out rule), monitor air supply, watch for backdraft conditions (sudden air inflow), beware of concrete spalling in high heat."}]}
