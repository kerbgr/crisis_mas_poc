  "description": "A sophisticated coordinated cyber attack has targeted Greece's critical infrastructure systems. The national power grid control systems, emergency services dispatch (112), hospital networks, and banking systems are experiencing widespread disruptions. Ransomware has encrypted essential data across multiple sectors. Traffic control systems in Athens are offline. There are indications of a nation-state actor. Emergency services are operating with degraded capabilities while essential services are failing.",
