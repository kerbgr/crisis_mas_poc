  "description": "A high-speed passenger train traveling from Athens to Thessaloniki has derailed near Tempe at 120 km/h after colliding with a freight train on the same track. Multiple carriages have overturned and caught fire. The train was carrying approximately 350 passengers. Initial reports indicate significant casualties with many people trapped in wreckage. Access is difficult due to remote location and ongoing fire. This is a mass casualty incident requiring extensive rescue operations.",
