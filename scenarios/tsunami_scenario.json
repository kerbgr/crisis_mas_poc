  "description": "A major underwater volcanic eruption and seismic event near Santorini has generated a tsunami. Wave heights of 8-15 meters are predicted to impact coastal areas of Crete, the Cyclades islands, and potentially the Greek mainland within 20-45 minutes. Coastal populations across multiple islands and mainland areas require immediate evacuation to high ground. Tourist season means significantly elevated population in affected areas.",
