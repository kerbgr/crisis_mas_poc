  "description": "A large oil tanker has collided with another vessel in the Saronic Gulf near Piraeus Port, resulting in a major oil spill. Approximately 50,000 tons of crude oil have been released into the sea. The spill is spreading toward coastal areas including popular beaches, the port of Piraeus, and environmentally sensitive areas. Wind and currents are pushing the oil slick toward Athens metropolitan coastline. Marine wildlife is at severe risk. Tourism and fishing industries face major impact.",
