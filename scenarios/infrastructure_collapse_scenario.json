  "description": "A 7-story residential apartment building in central Thessaloniki has suffered catastrophic structural collapse. The building housed approximately 80 residents across 35 apartments. Early morning collapse has trapped most residents inside. Initial reports indicate multiple casualties with many people trapped in rubble. Structural engineers report high risk of progressive collapse. Adjacent buildings have been evacuated due to structural concerns. This is an urban search and rescue emergency requiring specialized teams and equipment.",
